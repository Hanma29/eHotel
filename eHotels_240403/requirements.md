(30%) Web application: Design and implement an appropriate User Interface, through which
a user will be able to see the available rooms by giving different, multiple and combinations
of criteria in order to choose the room that he/she is interested in and book it or rent it. These
criteria should be: the dates (start, end) of booking or renting, the room capacity, the area, the
hotel chain, the category of the hotel, the total number of rooms in the hotel, the price of the
rooms. The user should be able to see the available choices when he/she changes the value of
any of these criteria.

The User Interface should allow the insert/delete/update of all information related to
customers, employees, hotels and rooms.

The user can be either a customer (who will use the interface in order to search for rooms and
do bookings) or a hotel employee (who will use the interface to either turn a booking to
renting when a customer checks in the hotel, or do directly a renting when a customer presents
physically to the hotel). An employee should be able to insert a customer payment for a
renting through the interface.

The user should be able to see in the User Interface the two specific SQL Views implemented
in (2f).

The User Interface should be user friendly, meaning that the user is not required to know
SQL. All information should be presented to the user through appropriately designed forms.
You should use appropriate elements, like drop-down lists, radio buttons etc.
